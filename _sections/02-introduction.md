Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are among the most productive photoautotrophic, aquatic microorganisms. They contribute an estimated 40-45% to the net primary production (NPP) of the oceans ([Mann, 1999](http://www.phycologia.org/doi/abs/10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1)), which themselves contribute approx. 45-50% to the global NPP ([Field et al., 1998](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5374/237)). Additionally, diatoms are important for the biogeochemical cycling of silicon, due to their ornate cell walls (called “frustules”) composed of biomineralised silica ([Bradbury, 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020306)). Cell division includes the separation of the two frustule parts (“thecae”) along a “girdle” region. Each daughter cell then complements its inherited epitheca with a newly synthesised, smaller hypotheca. Within these thecae, slits (called “raphes”) and pores may be present, facilitating the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS; ([Wetherbee et al., 1998](http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340009.x); [Wang et al., 2000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2000.99102.x/abstract)). This in turn conveys substrate attachment and motility to benthic diatoms, which often form biofilms with other photoautotrophic algae, as well as heterotrophic bacteria ([Buhmann, Kroth & Schleheck, 2012](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2011.00315.x/abstract)).

The diatom *Achnanthidium minutissimum* (Kützing) ([Czarnecki, 1994](http://www.algaebase.org/search/species/detail/?species_id=Ge79396858528c750)) is a cosmopolitan freshwater diatom ([Round & Bukhtiyarova, 1996](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0269249X.1996.9705389)) that is also found in the littoral zone of Lake Constance. It represents a dominant species complex of early colonisers ([Johnson, Tuchman & Peterson, 1997](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1468140); [Potapova & Hamilton, 2007](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00332.x/abstract)), forming epilithic biofilms in association with a variety of satellite bacteria ([Bahulikar, 2006](http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/handle/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-23773)). Such bacteria as well as their spent media have been shown to increase the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) like carbohydrates by *A. minutissimum* ([Bruckner et al., 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02411.x/full)). Additionally, growth as well as secretion of proteins and dissolved free amino acids was reportedly influenced in presence of bacteria ([Bruckner et al., 2008](http://aem.asm.org/content/74/24/7740.full), [2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02411.x/full)). Analogous to the rhizosphere of terrestrial environments (composed largely of fungi and bacteria associated with plant roots), a “phycosphere” has been defined as the space surrounding algal cells including the multitude of inter-kingdom interactions between bacteria and algae ([Bell, Lang & Mitchell, 1974](http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_19/issue_5/0833.html); [Amin, Parker & Armbrust, 2012](http://mmbr.asm.org/content/76/3/667)).

EPS secretion is of ecological relevance, contributing for instance to the stabilisation of sediments ([Cyr & Morton, 2006](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f06-079); [Lubarsky et al., 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013794)). Studying biofilm formation can therefore assist in the understanding of shore and coastline erosion as a result of climate-related changes (see section 3.2.1 of ([Widdows & Brinsley, 2002](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138511010200148X)) plus references therein). At the same time diatom settlement is one of the major causes of biofouling of man-made machinery in aquatic applications ([Molino & Wetherbee, 2008](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927010802254583)).

*A. minutissimum* is an excellent model for studying diatom biofilms, because this alga is abundant in natura ([Patrick & Reimer, 1966](https://repositories.tdl.org/tamug-ir/handle/1969.3/20795); [Krammer & Lange-Bertalot, 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=bjY7QAAACAAJ)) and can be cultivated in the laboratory both as “xenic” biofilms ([Myklestad et al., 1989](http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/4/763)) and “axenic” suspension cultures ([Windler et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12280/abstract)). Xenic cultures contain bacteria from the diatom's natural habitat. Removal of these bacteria is possible (for example by antibiotic treatment) and yields viable axenic cultures ([Bruckner & Kroth, 2009](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2009.00708.x/abstract); [Windler, Gruber & Kroth, 2012](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/21968)). Bacteria-free cultures allow the establishment of bioassays in order to study the interactions between diatoms and bacteria, although potentially unwelcome long-term effects have to be taken into account. For example, axenic cultivation can lead to a reduction of average cell size and to frustule deformations ([MacDonald, 1869](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222936908695866); [Pfitzer, 1871](http://books.google.de/books?id=DT89AQAAMAAJ); [Geitler, 1932](https://books.google.de/books?id=RZULAQAAIAAJ); [Windler et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pre.12059/abstract)). However, such deformations also occur naturally and can be used as stress markers, as well as water quality indicators ([Morin, Coste & Hamilton, 2008](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00587.x/abstract); [Falasco et al., 2009](http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/49185); [Cantonati et al., 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713011625)).
*A. minutissimum* forms biofilms and extracellular structures like stalks and capsules. These structures have been defined as “unidirectionally deposited, multi-layered structures attaching cells to substrata” ([Hoagland et al., 1993](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1993.00537.x/abstract)). Stalks have been investigated previously by transmission electron microscopy and biochemical techniques to elucidate structural morphology and chemical composition ([Daniel, Chamberlain & Jones, 1987](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00071618700650131)). Additionally, a phase model of diatom adhesion involving stalks has been developed ([Wang et al., 1997](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/113/4/1071)): Stalks may protrude from so called “basal pads” of aggregated EPS at the apical valve faces within hours to a few days, thus elevating the cells above the substrate. Capsule formation in *A. minutissimum* biofilms occurs later in the stationary phase, is possibly triggered by bacterial influences, and may cement diatom attachment ([Windler et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12280/abstract)). That study also found that axenic *A. minutissimum* cultures mostly secrete soluble carbohydrates while the insoluble carbohydrates in xenic cultures were positively correlated with the appearance of capsules.

Diatom capsules have puzzled phycologists for a long time and their potential physiological and ecological function have elicited a variety of hypotheses ([Lewin, 1955](http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/13/1/162); [Geitler, 1977](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00986291)). For example, capsules have been proposed to participate in locomotion, flotation, attachment, waste removal, catchment of inorganic nutrients, storage of polysaccharides, sexual reproduction, as well as protection against grazing and dehydration. More recently, it was demonstrated that capsule formation is dependent on at least “a certain minimum light intensity”, sparking the idea that capsules might serve as an additional polysaccharide storage pool, once intracellular capacities are saturated ([Staats et al., 2000](http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v193/p261-269/)).

Diatom capsules and other extracellular material have been characterised biochemically, while electron microscopy has enabled highly detailed morphological characterisations of diatom frustules ([Toyoda et al., 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670260500150511), [2006](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1835.2006.00420.x/abstract); [Potapova & Hamilton, 2007](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00332.x/abstract)). Additionally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed many mechanical properties of the extracellular polymers of some diatoms ([Crawford et al., 2001](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.037004543.x/abstract); [Higgins et al., 2003](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2003.02163.x/abstract); [Willis et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.12103/abstract)). In the present study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were employed to analyse the microstructure and development stages of *Achnanthidium minutissimum* capsules in order to further develop this species as a model system for diatom-bacteria interactions, and to elucidate one aspect of the complex interactions of diatoms and other microorganisms.
