## Notes

* If you rename your forked repository, you also need to change the `baseurl` setting in [_config.yml](_config.yml) to match.
* It's not possible to fork the same repository twice in GitHub, so to create a second article you'll need to create a new repository in GitHub, clone this repository locally and push it to your new repository.
