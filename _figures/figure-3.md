title: Comparison of microstructures on *A. minutissimum* cell surfaces in a xenic biofilm.
description: **A** (scale bar: 2 µm): Capsule material is sometimes stretched between cells and/or towards the substrate (arrows). Culture was 11 days old at the time of fixation for SEM. Asterisks denote magnified areas B and C. **B** (scale bar: 1 µm): Non-encapsulated cells possess a fibrillar mesh of varying degrees of density. Frustule pores are only partially covered and in some cases, fibrils stick out from the frustule. **C** (scale bar: 1 µm): Encapsulated cells are completely covered with a material of slightly granular structure, but lacking clearly discernible features.
