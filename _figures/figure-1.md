description: Micrograph depicts 11 days old culture and is a merge of the chlorophyll fluorescence channel (red; indicating diatom cells) and the bright-field image (grey). Some mature capsules are marked with arrows. Bright spots within diatom cells are lipid bodies. Bacteria are visible as light and dark speckles around and in between the diatom cells.
